# Music Recommendation using music-elements


## Use Case
This project enables us to compare and match songs purely based on their musical features, as opposed to audio-signal elements.

## Motivation
Spotify does NOT have a musical-element based comparison method. They are missing out on recommending songs that are very relevant.
